Example add-on by Community Hass.io add-ons.

## About

This is an example add-on for Hass.io. When started, it displays a
random quote every 5 seconds.

It shows off several features and structures like:

- Full blown GitHub repository.
- General Dockerfile structure and setup.
- The use of the `config.json` and `build.json` files.
- General shell scripting structure (`run.sh`).
- Quality assurance using CodeClimate.
- Continuous integration and deployment using CircleCI.
- Usage of the Community Hass.io Add-ons build environment.
- Small use of the Bash function library in our base images.
- The use of Docker label schema.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Example" add-on
1. Start the "Example" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "Example" add-on to see it in action.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

Eventought this add-on is just an example add-on, it does come with some
configuration options to play around with.

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "seconds_between_quotes": 5
}
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `seconds_between_quotes`

Sets the number of seconds between the output of each quote. The value
must be between `1` and `120` seconds. This value is set to `5` seconds by
default.

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
