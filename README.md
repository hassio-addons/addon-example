Agent DVR is a standalone replacement for iSpy that runs as a service, uses less CPU and features a web user interface that is accessible from anywhere with no port forwarding required!

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "AgentDVR" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Start the "AgentDVR" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "AgentDVR" to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button, and set up your cameras.
1. Ready to go!

**Note**: _AgentDVR configuration will be stored in /config/agentdvr and the default recording storage has been set to /media/AgentDVR. This allows users to access and video recording via the Home Assistant media browser._

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration, with all available options:

```yaml
log_level: info
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.
